# GRAPHS
A type of non linear data structures that consists of nodes connected with lines called edges.

- Vertex --> also called a node, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- Edge --> the connection between two nodes.
- Neighbor --> the node attached to another through edge.
- Degree --> the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Features
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

- add node

--> Arguments: value

--> Returns: The added node

- Add a node to the graph

- add edge

--> Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)

--> Returns: nothing

- Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph

--> If specified, assign a weight to the edge

--> Both nodes should already be in the Graph

- get nodes

--> Arguments: none

--> Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

- get neighbors

--> Arguments: node

--> Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node

- Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
size

--> Arguments: none

--> Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
