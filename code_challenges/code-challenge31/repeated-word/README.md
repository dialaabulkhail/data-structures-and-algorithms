- Arguments: string
- Return: string

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
- Big O time complextiry of repeated_word function is O(n) because we iterate through the n size of string.
- Big O space complexity of repeated_word function is O(1) because each time the function gets excuted it will give the same word from the string.
